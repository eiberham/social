# Social
A social event scheduling and promoting web app.

This app is intended to let us set and manage events ( it was designed mostly thinking in party events ) and promote them by showing the most recent ones. The idea is to escale it in order to even support paying tickets, so if you wanna know what parties are occuring today you can go on the website and check by yourself, and in case you wish to attend a particular event you can buy the ticket upfront from the platform.

This app was also an excuse to practice the usage of typescript and redux/saga with react and to leave a reference online for future projects i might be working on, so hope you like it and get inspired.
